== four reasons to change a software

* adding feature
* fixing a bug
* improve the design
* optimizing resource usage

=== behavior

* users depend on it

=== what changes when software is changed

=== preserve behaviour

* with introducing behaviour change, much more has to be preserved

=== when doing software change two things has to be in mind

* make sure that change is correct
* preserve behaviour of the rest

=== why preservation is challenging and risky

* it is not known how much of behaviour is at risk when doing change
* the amount of behaviour to preserve is large

=== how to mitigate the risk

* what changes has to be make?
* how do I know that they are done correctly?
* how do I know that they didn't break anything?

== two ways of making a change

* "`edit and pray`"
* "`cover and modify`"

== legacy code

=== what is it?

* it is code without tests

=== why is it hard to change?

* codebase is large
* no way of knowing if changes are done correctly
* no way of knowing if changes didn't break anything
* it is hard to write unit tests

=== why is it hard to write unit tests

* classes have dependencies on external data sources, file system etc.

== michael feathers legacy code changing algorithm

* identify change points
* find test points
* break dependencies
* write tests
* make changes and refactor

=== identify change points

place in the software where change has to be made

=== find test points

what classes/functions has to be tested

=== break dependencies

remove dependencies and enable tests

=== write tests

write tests that gives immediate feedback about changes impact

=== make changes and refactor
